# livefloppy
Livefloppy is a way to turn a floppy into a live cd, essentially booting you into the floppy, by default it runs shell, but you can install other os'es (Tested with OpusOS) This works on any pc, except the ones that don't allow booting from a floppy 


## IMPORTANT!!!
  The computer you put this on will be turned into a livefloppy writer!
  So when you do this, files on that computer become hard-ish to recover, we are not responsible for any files lost.
  Use a clean computer when installing this, or a garbage computer.
  
## Install
 Just run `wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omegacoustics/livefloppy/master/install.lua`
 This is a simple script just running wget on the static url's, you can also do this yourself if you want to:
 
 Run wget on the 3 files: (not recommended)
 startup.lua
 livefloppy/startup.lua
 livefloppy/logo.txt
