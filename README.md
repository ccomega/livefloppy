# livefloppy
Livefloppy is a way to turn a floppy into a live cd, essentially booting you into the floppy, by default it runs shell, but you can install other os'es (Tested with OpusOS)


## IMPORTANT!!!
  The computer you put this on will be turned into a livefloppy writer!
  So when you do this, files on that computer become hard-ish to recover, we are not responsible for any files lost.
  Use a clean computer when installing this, or a garbage computer.
  
## Install
 Just run `wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omegacoustics/livefloppy/master/install.lua`
 This is a simple script just running wget on the static url's, you can also do this yourself if you want to:
 
 Run wget on the 3 files: (not recommended)
 startup.lua
 livefloppy/startup.lua
 livefloppy/logo.txt
